        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>After 30 years in Medicine and raising a family, it was time for a change. 
            Moving to Central Oregon was just the beginning. After a simple woodturning 
            class and reengaging in a love for artistic expression and technical craftsmanship, 
            Twistwood Studio was born. Lathe turned bowls, hand carved utensils, trays, 
            wood sculptures, and more. <br>
            The vast majority of our work is done with natural 
            materials obtained in Oregon. We take raw logs of local Juniper, regionally obtained 
            Walnut and Maple species usually knocked down by storms or otherwise harvested, and 
            cut them down to workable sizes in our home shop. It is important that we use as much of 
            the logs as possible and minimize waste. We are not striving for perfection in every wood piece, 
            but rather look to exploit the imperfections (such as natural cracks, checks, knots, and live edges) 
            for uniqueness and character. <br>
            Finishes used are natural oils and waxes which are food safe. Our
             techniques include turning on a lathe, hand carving, chisels, hand axe, power carving, band saw, 
             among others. All pieces are then hand sanded and finished</p>
